# GeoMetrics
We're trying to implement a program that tracks user's cursor movement as they draw the shape, get (x,y) values, use those values to determine circuference d as a sum of distances calculated from the points

MATLAB
LabVIEW

Steps:
1. Work towards perfecting method for finding ellipse's circumeference
2. Test with other shapes and modify method if needed
3. Implement ML for program to identify shape from pdf input
